# Example environment variables for deploying Connector-java on Render
# Copy this file and fill values locally for testing or configure these variables directly in Render's Web Service Environment tab.

# Mode: BIGQUERY = production, LOCAL = dev/test
connector.mode=LOCAL

# BigQuery configuration (used if connector.mode=BIGQUERY)
# NOTE: We recommend using GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON and writing it to a file at runtime instead of storing a file path
google.project.id=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
bigquery.dataset=YOUR_DATASET
bigquery.table=students

# If you prefer to pass the service account JSON directly, add it as an environment variable (masked/secret in Render):
# Paste the entire JSON content as a single-line or use proper quoting in Render's UI
# WARNING: Do NOT commit this value to the repo.
# GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON={...}

# If you plan to use a file path for the credentials inside the container, Render will not persist files across deployments; prefer the JSON variable
# When starting the container we will write GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON to a file and pass the path with --google.credentials.path

# App security (API key for /bq endpoint)
app.api.key=YOUR_API_KEY

# Metabase embedding (optional)
app.metabase.url=https://metabase.example.com
app.metabase.embed-secret=your_metabase_secret

# Server port (optional - Render sets a port, but the app uses 8080 by default)
server.port=8080

# JVM options (optional)
JAVA_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx512m

# Healthchecks (exposed route) - just reference
# Health check path: /students/health
